!CHAPTER Replication Overhead

As the master servers are logging any write operation in the write-ahead-log anyway replication doesn't cause any extra overhead on the master. However it will of course cause some overhead for the master to serve incoming read requests of the slaves. Returning the requested data is however a trivial task for the master and should not result in a notable performance degration in production.

!CHAPTER Graphs

The *Graphs* tab provides a viewer facility for graph data stored in ArangoDB. It
allows browsing ArangoDB graphs stored in the *_graphs* system collection or a
graph consisting of an arbitrary vertex and [edge collection](../../Appendix/Glossary.md#edge-collection).

Please note that the graph viewer requires client-side SVG and that you need a
browser capable of rendering that. Especially Internet Explorer browsers older
than version 9 are likely to not support this.

Upgrading a cluster
===================

This page will guide you through the process of an in-place upgrade (see also
[General Upgrade Information](GeneralUpgradeInformation.md)). The different
nodes in a cluster can be updated one at a time without incurring downtime
of the cluster and very short downtimes of the single nodes.

`Kickstarter.cleanup()`

This cleans up all the data and logs of a previously shut down cluster.
To this end, other dispatchers are contacted as necessary.
[Use shutdown](../ModulePlanner/README.md#shutdown) first and
use with caution, since potentially a lot of data is being erased with
this call!
